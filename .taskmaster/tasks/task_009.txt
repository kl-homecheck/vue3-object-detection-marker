# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Visual Feedback System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive visual feedback system that highlights selected grid cells, shows grid boundaries, and provides real-time feedback during selection operations.
# Details:
1. Extend the CanvasManager to render selected grids:
```typescript
drawSelectedGrids(color: string = 'rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.5)'): void {
  this.ctx.fillStyle = color;
  
  this.selectedGrids.forEach(key => {
    const [row, col] = key.split(',').map(Number);
    const { x, y, width, height } = this.getGridBounds(row, col);
    this.ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);
  });
}

drawTemporarySelection(tempGrids: Set<string>, color: string = 'rgba(255, 123, 0, 0.5)'): void {
  this.ctx.fillStyle = color;
  
  tempGrids.forEach(key => {
    const [row, col] = key.split(',').map(Number);
    const { x, y, width, height } = this.getGridBounds(row, col);
    this.ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);
  });
}

render(): void {
  if (!this.image) return;
  
  // Clear canvas
  this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
  
  // Draw image
  this.ctx.drawImage(this.image, 0, 0);
  
  // Draw selected grids
  this.drawSelectedGrids();
  
  // Draw grid
  this.drawGrid();
}
```
2. Implement cursor style changes based on current mode
3. Add hover effects for grid cells
4. Implement visual indicators for current mode (point/rectangle/eraser)
5. Add animation effects for selection/deselection
6. Implement color customization for different visual elements
7. Ensure high contrast for accessibility

# Test Strategy:
1. Test rendering of selected grid cells
2. Verify visual feedback during selection operations
3. Test cursor style changes based on mode
4. Verify hover effects work correctly
5. Test visual indicators for different modes
6. Verify color customization works
7. Test accessibility with different color schemes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Grid Highlighting System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the CanvasManager to properly render selected and temporarily selected grid cells with appropriate visual styling.
### Details:
Refine the existing drawSelectedGrids and drawTemporarySelection methods to ensure proper rendering of selected cells. Add visual distinction between permanent and temporary selections. Ensure the render method properly calls these methods in the correct order. Test with different grid sizes and selection patterns.

## 2. Add Interactive Hover Effects [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement hover effects for grid cells to provide immediate visual feedback when users interact with the grid.
### Details:
Create a new method in CanvasManager to handle hover effects. Track the currently hovered cell using mouse movement events. Implement a subtle highlight effect that doesn't interfere with selection highlighting. Add event listeners for mouseenter and mouseleave on grid cells. Ensure hover effects are disabled during drag operations.

## 3. Implement Mode-Based Visual Indicators [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create visual indicators that clearly show the current selection mode (point, rectangle, or eraser) to improve user experience.
### Details:
Design and implement distinct cursor styles for each mode (point/rectangle/eraser). Add a mode indicator in a corner of the canvas that shows the current active mode with an icon. Implement smooth transitions between mode indicators. Ensure high contrast for accessibility. Update indicators in real-time when mode changes.

## 4. Add Selection Animation Effects [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement subtle animation effects for selection and deselection operations to provide better visual feedback to users.
### Details:
Create animation effects for newly selected cells (e.g., fade-in or pulse effect). Implement deselection animations (e.g., fade-out effect). Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations. Ensure animations are subtle and don't distract from the main functionality. Add option to disable animations for users who prefer no animations.

## 5. Implement Visual Customization Options [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create a system for customizing colors and visual properties of the feedback system while ensuring accessibility standards are met.
### Details:
Implement color customization for grid lines, selection highlights, hover effects, and mode indicators. Create a settings interface for users to adjust visual properties. Store user preferences in localStorage. Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements. Provide preset high-contrast themes for accessibility. Add preview functionality for visual changes before applying them.
